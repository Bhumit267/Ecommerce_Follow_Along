# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

# MERN E-Commerce Application

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my first step into web development, where I'll be building a simple online store from scratch. I'm learning the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) through this project, and I'll be documenting my journey here.

---

## Milestone 1: Project Overview

In today's session, we covered:
1. Understanding what we're going to build
   - A simple online store with products and a shopping cart
   - A place for users to create accounts and log in

2. Setting up our development environment
   - Creating a GitHub repository
   - Learning about README files
   - Understanding project documentation

3. Planning our learning path
   - Breaking down the project into smaller pieces
   - Setting realistic goals for each milestone
   - Understanding what we'll learn along the way

## Milestone 2: Login Page Implementation

In this milestone, I've added a *login page* using React and styled it with *Tailwind CSS*. This marks an important step in the project as I'm now able to create a simple user login system. 

*Key updates include:*
- *Login Page UI:* Created a simple login page where users can input their credentials (email and password).
- *Tailwind CSS Integration:* Used Tailwind to quickly style the login page with modern UI components.
- *React State Management:* Managed form inputs and basic state within the React app to handle login credentials.

This login page will serve as the foundation for adding authentication functionality in the future.

## Milestone 3: Backend Implementation - Completed

The backend portion of the project has been completed. This includes setting up the server, connecting to the database, and creating basic API routes for handling product and user data. 

*Key updates include:*
- *Express Server Setup:* Set up the backend server using Express.js to handle API requests.
- *MongoDB Database Connection:* Established a connection to MongoDB to store user and product data.
- *User Authentication Routes:* Created routes for user registration, login, and authentication.
- *Product Routes:* Created routes for fetching product data and displaying it to the frontend.

With the backend in place, the frontend can now interact with the server to handle product display, user login, and more.

## Milestone 4: User Model, Controller, and File Uploads - Completed

In this milestone, I focused on enhancing the backend functionality by creating a user model, controller, and enabling file uploads.

*Key updates include:*
- *User Model:* Designed a blueprint for storing user data (name, email, password) in MongoDB, using Mongoose schemas.
- *User Controller:* Created a controller to manage user-related actions, such as user registration and authentication.
- *Multer Integration:* Configured Multer to handle file uploads, allowing users to upload profile pictures and store them on the server.

### Key Concepts Covered:
1. *Whatâ€™s a Model?*
   - A model defines how data is structured in the database. The *User Model* defines how user information like name, email, and password will be stored in the database using a Mongoose schema.

2. *Whatâ€™s a Controller?*
   - A controller manages the logic of handling user requests and responses. The *User Controller* handles tasks like creating a new user or authenticating an existing one.

3. *File Uploads with Multer:*
   - Multer was integrated to enable file uploads, such as profile pictures. Multer stores uploaded files on the server and makes it easier to manage them.

With these updates, the project is now capable of handling user registration and authentication, along with storing user-uploaded files like images.

## Project Description

I'm creating a basic online store where users can browse products, add them to a cart, and pretend to buy them (no real payments yet!). This is my first full-stack project, and I'm excited to learn how websites actually work behind the scenes. The project will start simple and grow as I learn more.

---

## Learning Goals ðŸŽ¯

As a beginner, I'm hoping to:
- Understand how websites are built from front to back
- Learn to write my first server code with Node.js
- Create my first database with MongoDB
- Build my first React application
- Figure out how all these pieces work together!

## Key Features of the Project

### MERN Stack
I'm learning these four technologies:
- *MongoDB:* Where I'll store all my project's data
- *Express:* Helps me create a server
- *React:* For building the website's interface
- *Node.js:* Lets me run JavaScript outside the browser

### REST API Creation
I'll be learning how to:
- Create my first API endpoints
- Send data between the frontend and backend
- Handle basic requests like getting product lists

### Authentication
Starting with simple features:
- *Basic login page* (completed!)
- User registration
- Learning about passwords and security

### Database Schema Design
My first database will include:
- A simple product list
- Basic user information
- Order details

### Backend Development (Completed!)
The backend is fully functional and includes:
- Setting up a server
- Connecting to a database
- Handling basic requests like user authentication and product management

### Frontend Development
Starting with:
- Creating simple pages
- Making a basic shopping cart
- Displaying products

### Core Concepts Covered

#### Overview of the MERN Stack
I'll be learning:
- What each technology does
- How they work together
- Basic setup and configuration

#### REST API Structure and Endpoints
Starting with:
- What an API is
- How to create basic routes
- Sending and receiving data

#### Basics of Database Schema Design
Learning about:
- What a database schema is
- How to store product information
- Basic data relationships

#### Role of Authentication in Web Applications
Understanding:
- Why we need user accounts
- How to keep passwords safe
- Basic login/logout functionality
